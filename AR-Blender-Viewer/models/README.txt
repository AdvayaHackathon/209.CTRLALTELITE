PLACE YOUR 3D MODEL HERE

Instructions:
1. Export your model from Blender as a .glb or .gltf file
2. Name the file "model.glb" for automatic detection, or update the path in main.js
3. Make sure your model is optimized for mobile devices:
   - Keep polygon count under 50,000 if possible
   - Texture sizes under 2048x2048
   - Remove unnecessary details not visible at normal viewing distance

For testing, you can download sample .glb models from:
- https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/master/2.0
- https://sketchfab.com/3d-models?features=downloadable&sort_by=-likeCount

Tips for good AR performance:
- Center your model at origin (0,0,0) in Blender before exporting
- Apply all transformations and modifiers before export
- Consider creating a low-poly version if performance is an issue
- Pre-bake lighting if your model has complex materials
